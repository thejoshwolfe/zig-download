# zig-download

Tool for downloading precompiled zig tarballs from https://ziglang.org/download/ .
This is basically the same thing as [zigup](https://github.com/marler8997/zigup), but I wrote this one as an exercise.

Usage:

```
zig run zig-download.zig
```

Then put the following on your PATH: `~/zig-downloads/active`
